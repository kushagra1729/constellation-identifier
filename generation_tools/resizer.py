# Description: Resizes batches of 1920x1080 images into 960x540 using interpolation.
# Manual: ./resize.py /path/to 1234
#           where /path/to is the batch directory and 1234 is the number of images
#           and images are named from 0.png to 1234.png
# Issues: Is single threaded, would be faster if multi, but not required for now. Fuck you, GIL.
#         Cwd cannot contain spaces.
